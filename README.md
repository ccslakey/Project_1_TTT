This is my Tic-Tac-Toe application. It was made using JavaScript/Jquery, keeping in mind object oriented programming principles


### Technologies Used
Git/Github for repository/version control and storing changes to code
Jquery: selectors, methods, working with objects, conrstructs, events
OOP design patterns


###Existing features
-Set moves
-Won't replay a square
-Reset board at anytime
-3 wins in a row gives you a nice message congratulating the winner
-Uses constructors and functions to: establish control flow and logic, 		determine winning moves, and generally access most features of the 
	game



###Planned features
Nice styling elements such as new photos
User inputs for moves/pictures
Hover/Mouseover events to increase interactiveness

This is my Tic-Tac-Toe application. It was made using JavaScript/Jquery, keeping in mind object oriented programming principles


### Technologies Used
Git/Github for repository/version control and storing changes to code
Jquery: selectors, methods, working with objects, conrstructs, events
OOP design patterns


###Existing features <br>
-Set moves <br>
-Won't replay a square <br>
-Reset board at anytime <br>
-3 wins in a row gives you a nice message congratulating the winner <br>
-Uses constructors and functions to: establish control flow and logic, determine winning moves, and generally access most features of the 
	game



###Planned features <br>
Fix cookies theme: thumbnails look like ridiculous avant-garde art <br>
User inputs for moves/pictures<br>
Hover/Mouseover events to increase interactiveness<br>
Incoporate an "Object-Oriented(OO) Approach in a Model-View-Controller(MVC) Pattern, using the Publish-Subscribe Model, <br>Namespacing, and Immediately-Invoked-Function-Expression(IIFE) <br>(from here: "http://mamallamacoding.blogspot.com/2014/03/making-tictactoe-with-object-oriented.html")
